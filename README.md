Background
----------

My HAC is a smartphone and tablet application designed for students in school districts that use the eSchoolPlus Home Access Center system for managing grades and other student information. The interface is designed to better conform to a small screen size with improved ease of use. Currently you can view grades and attendance information. Some of the planned features include: live class schedules, disable sound during school, calendar integration, and much more. Please note, as this is a free app created by an active student, do not expect this to be a perfect app. Created and tested by a student at Council Rock High school North.

Why Open Source?
----------------
- As an app designed for students and involving potentially sensitive data, keeping the app totally open source means that schools and students can trust the product they are endorsing by using this app. All the code available here is identical to what is released onto the app stores for public use.
- In the spirit of education, seeing the code behind the apps they are using can teach students how to make similiar programs.
- Anyone can contribute. This means that the app can stay up-to-date and bug free longer.
- Free!
